# Shopee Logistics Performance

Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, many individuals are increasingly turning to online platforms like Shopee to purchase their daily necessities. This surge in online orders has placed a strain onto Shopee and our logistics providers but customer expectations on the timely delivery of their goods remain high. On time delivery is arguably one of the most important factors of success in the eCommerce industry and now more than ever, we need to ensure the orders reach our buyers on time in order to build our users' confidence in us.
